# badlib

**badlib** (derived from BIP-39 Answers Desk) is a lightweight Rust library for interacting with the BIP-39 wordlist. It provides functions to convert between binary, decimal, and BIP-39 words efficiently.

Calculating or verifying a BIP-39 mnemonic phrase can be complex. `badlib` simplifies this process by modularizing lookups for individual words. Other tools and libraries within the `btctools` suite can query `badlib` to quickly retrieve a word's decimal index, binary representation, or mnemonic equivalentâ€”and vice versa.

**Note:** `badlib` is now part of the [btctools](https://github.com/rghollenbeck/btctools) suite, a toolbox of libraries and utilities for Bitcoin developers and enthusiasts.

## Features
- Convert **binary to word**.
- Convert **decimal to word**.
- Convert **word to binary**.
- Convert **word to decimal**.
- Modular design, enabling integration with other Bitcoin-related libraries and tools.

## Usage

### Example Code
Below is an example of how to use `badlib` in your Rust project:

```rust
use badlib::{load_wordlist, binary_to_word, decimal_to_word, word_to_binary, word_to_decimal};

fn main() {
    let word_list = load_wordlist("data/bip39list.json").expect("Failed to load wordlist");

    // Binary to Word
    assert_eq!(binary_to_word(&word_list, "00000000000"), Some("abandon"));

    // Decimal to Word
    assert_eq!(decimal_to_word(&word_list, 5), Some("absent"));

    // Word to Binary
    assert_eq!(word_to_binary(&word_list, "abandon"), Some("00000000000"));

    // Word to Decimal
    assert_eq!(word_to_decimal(&word_list, "abandon"), Some(0));
}
```

### Installation
1. Add `badlib` as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:
   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   badlib = "0.1.0"
   ```

2. Import `badlib` into your project:
   ```rust
   use badlib::*;
   ```
